### SVG

- we can use SVG(Image format) for a good pixel quality.(The image quality remains same even if it is zoomed)
- The image file size will also be small
- For logos on websites, SVG is a good option

# JavaScript

> Datatypes available in JS:

- object
- number
- string
- undefined
- Boolean

> Declaration in JS:

- var (Redeclaration and Reassign is possible)
- let (Redeclaration is not possible and Reassign is possible)
- const (Both Redeclaration and Reassign is not possible)

> Scope : Lifetime of a variable

- let and const - block scope
- var - function scope

undefined-> its about a value(i.e, though variable is declared but it is not assigned with a value)
not defined -> its an error
